This repository contains following code in "code":
1) TiebaCrawler.py, it has some functions to crawl tieba
2) crawlTiezi.py and crawlUserAndTieba.py, they use the functions in TiebaCrawler.py to crawl tiezi. Use multiple threads in crawlTiezi
3) countReply.py to count the reply number between users
4) simpleNlp.py, use tfidf to do some analyze(?)
5) tryWord2vec.py, use word2vec for fun

The definition of database's tables is in "data/sql.txt"

Terrible and ugly code, I will make it look beautiful one day.
